# Meaningful-Projects-in-C

This repository consists of all of my prevous labs, projects, and teamworks written in C, C++, and C#. Having a wide range of works, from easy algorithm testing and data structures creation to large tests on large database, these projects will be all uploaded in a rolling process.
